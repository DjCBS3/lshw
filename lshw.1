.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP

\fBlshw\fR
is a small tool to extract detailed information on the hardware
configuration of the machine. It can report exact memory
configuration, firmware version, mainboard configuration, 
CPU version
and speed, cache configuration, bus speed, etc. on 
DMI-capable x86
systems and on some PowerPC
machines (PowerMac G4 is known to work).
.PP
It currently supports DMI (x86 only), OpenFirmware device tree (PowerPC only),
PCI/AGP, CPUID (x86), IDE/ATA/ATAPI, PCMCIA (only tested on x86) and SCSI.
